# Overview of machine learning for screening text software 

The repository aims to create an overview and comparison of software used for
systematically screening large amounts of textual data using machine learning.

# Overview

The table below provides a quick overview of the software. The following
properties are evaluated:

-	Is the software free and [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) (provide a :link: to the source code)?
-	Is the software published in a scientific article (provide a [DOI](https://www.doi.org/))?
-	Is documentation or a manual available (give a :link:)?
-	What type of machine learning is applied in the software (choose from **S**upervised, **U**nsupervised, **A**ctive)? – more details are compared in the tables about the [ML-properties](machine-learning-properties)
-	Is the user in control of the machine learning (yes, no, and add a `+` if users can add their own models)?



| Software | Open-Source | Published | Documentation | Type of ML | Control over ML | Multi-user | 
|:--------:|:-----------:|:---------:|:-------------:|:----------:|:---------------:|:----------:|


:white_check_mark: Yes/Implemented
:x: No/Not implemented
:zap: With some effort (add a :link: to more explaination)
:grey_question: Unknown (requires an issue)

# Data

The table below provides an overview of input/output data.

- What type of data can be imported (RIS, TSV, CSV, XLSX, TAB)?
- Can partly labeled data be imported (yes/no/:zap: only for some extensions)?
- Does the export file contain the labeling decissions?
- Can the export file be re-imported into same software with the labeling decissions?
- Can the export file be re-imported into reference manager software including the labeling decission?

| Software | Type of Data | Partly labelled | Labeling decissions | Re-Import-1  | Re-Import-2 |
|:--------:|:---------- -:|:---------------:|:-------------------:|:------------:|:-----------:|


:white_check_mark: Yes/Implemented
:x: No/Not implemented
:zap: Only for some extensions (add a :link: to more explaination)
:grey_question: Unknown (requires an issue)
